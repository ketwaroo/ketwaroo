This is propably the least impressive porfolio page you'll ever see, so let's call it a work in progress for now. Portfolios are meant to show you what the author has created at a glance, however I don't do things "at a glance". 

## What I do

Professionally, and in a nutshell, I've been coding in PHP and wring HTML,JS,CSS for the past 15+ years. I don't like making things complicated and have a hard time singing my own praises. I have frequently been told that that my work is "vastly beyond expectations" and "extremely impressive", which means either I'm routinely understimated or I'm really good at what I do.

## What I've done

#### The more impresive stuff that's still in the public domain

 * https://data.cms.gov
   * I had a major hand in the API portion of this site. We had to work under alot of contraints but still managed to deliver something that worked performantly. A lot of the work I did was on the backend, API and devops, as well as admin panel access for end users. It's not shiny/glittery stuff but you wouldn't have anything usable on the frontend without it.
 * https://nccourts.gov
   * Another government website. Also a huge backend effort with a lot of interconnected systems.

## What I can do

That's up to what the job requires. My core belief is that a programmer should not be limited by what they already know or are certified in. If the documentation exists, I can make it happen.
