The name's @ketwaroo.

The official tag line: Highly adaptable full-stack software engineer with over 15 years of experience in web services and application development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL stacks and various frontend frameworks.

I mostly code in PHP and all manner of things that will render HTML in a browser but my skills are not limited to LAMP stacks and web development.
I can pretty much pick up most things by poking at the documentation a little. Programmers aren't limited to specific languages or frameworks they already know. We learn and adapt to the job

PHP is my main thing though. If your company uses PHP or any kind of PHP stack, there is no doubt that I can become an expert with your systems much faster that you thought possible. 

Note that this is my personal github account and a dumping ground for random projects. I feel like maintaining a separate "professional" account would be contributing to e-waste.

See my sort of [Portfolio](portfolio.md). Not the best of thing but it is a thing.
